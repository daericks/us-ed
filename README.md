# US-ED

us-ed is a project exploring the [U.S. Education Datasets: Unification Project](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project) dataset. The main project is to infer features predictive of academic performance. I find that academic performance is strongly correlated with preivous performance. Increasing enrollment in the state is correlated with increasing acadmice performance, while larger support services spending and more student enrollment in a grade negatively impact academic performance in that grade.   Exploratory analysis is also included. The project is composed entirely in Jupyter notebooks. 

## Installation

Nothing to install. Launch jupyter and explore the notebooks.
